Division Calculator

Improvements
Added error handling for empty inputs.
Implemented regex validation to check for invalid characters.
Added try-catch block to handle division by zero and non-numeric inputs.
Used Object.fromEntries to extract form data.
Challenges Faced
Handling Empty Inputs: Ensuring that the application gracefully handles cases where one or both inputs are empty without crashing or displaying incorrect results.
Regex Validation: Designing a regular expression that accurately validates input to ensure it only contains numeric characters.
Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling to catch and display meaningful messages for various types of errors, such as division by zero or non-numeric inputs.
Conclusion
This project was a valuable learning experience that helped me improve my JavaScript skills, especially in the areas of form handling and error management. It challenged me to think critically about input validation and error prevention, ultimately leading to a more robust and user-friendly application.
